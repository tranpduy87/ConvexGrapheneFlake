# ConvexGrapheneFlake

The input for running the simulation using LAMMPS.
C1_5nm corresponds to the graphene size L=1.5nm
C2_0nm corresponds to the graphene size L=2.0nm

The data.C files in each folder provide the coordinates of Carbon atoms.
The in.C.lammps files in each folder provide the MD simulation settings.
Please note that the length of vdW supportive sphere is needed to modify for each run.
